# Tutorial: The Coma Cluster

## Technical Notes
This repository contains the Latex source files and compiled pdf of the Coma Cluster EURO-VO tutorial (http://www.euro-vo.org/sites/default/files/documents/tutorial-abel1656_2019Dec.pdf). 

To compile the Latex source you will need the style file and the images from the template and image repository (https://github.com/EURO-VO/Tutorials_ESCAPE_templates_Images)

## Summary of the Tutorial
The goals of this tutorial are:
 - Examine the Coma cluster of galaxies (Abell 1656) using VO data and tools in order to perform a quick evaluation of the mean redshift and velocity dispersion of the cluster.
 - Use redshifts and photometry (Petrosian r magnitude) of the SDSS survey and then add redshifts of the CAIRNS survey (Rines et al. 2003) in order to improve the completeness of the redshift sample.
 - Look for hydrogen lines in HST spectra in the direction of this cluster and check whether the lines are consistent with foreground or with galaxy velocities.
 
The software packages we require to tackle these tasks are Aladin, TOPCAT and Cassis.
